# Responsive-Club-Website

This is a Codecademy project from their Full-Stack Engineer career path.

# Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen! This project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. You can base it on real-life organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to choose everything about your page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that you want to use, and more! Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned. In our example project, we use percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, in our CSS to size and position page elements. We also made our website responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.
